    "content": "and Media Pacific Valley Bancorp Announces Its Second Quarter 2025 Financial Results PR Newswire SALINAS, Calif. , July 28, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Pacific Valley Bancorp (OTC Pink: PVBK) announced its unaudited financial results for the second quarter of 2025. Net income for the quarter ended June 30, 2025 , was $923 thousand , a decrease of 9.0% or $91 thousand from the quarter ended June 30 , 2024, primarily due to higher personnel expense. FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS: Net income for the quarter ended June 30, 2025 , was $923 thousand , a decrease of 2.3% or $22 thousand from the quarter ended March 31, 2025 . The decrease was primarily the result of higher personnel expense from an increase in staff, partially offset by higher loan interest income. Basic earnings per share for the quarter was $0.19 compared to $0.19 per share for the prior quarter. Net income for the six months ended June 30, 2025 was $1.9 million , a decrease of 15.7% or $348 thousand from the six months ended June 30, 2024 . The decrease was the result of higher personnel expense and higher deposit interest expense, partially offset by higher loan interest income. Net interest margin for the quarter ended June 30, 2025 was 3.61%, compared with 3.43% for the quarter ended March 31, 2025 . The increase was the result of higher loan interest income and lower certificate of deposit interest expense, partially offset by higher money market interest expense. Net interest margin for the six months ended June 30, 2025 was 3.50%, compared with 3.45% for the six months ended June 30, 2024 . Gross loans outstanding grew by 9.5% or $43.5 million from June 30, 2024 to June 30, 2025 , primarily as a result of increased agricultural real estate, CRE and C&I loans. Non-performing loans to gross loans for the quarter ended June 30, 2025 , was 0.04% compared to 0.22% as of June 30, 2024 . The Bank subsidiary's Community Bank Leverage Ratio has been consistently strong. As of June 30, 2025 the ratio was 13.37%, compared to 13.27% on March 31, 2025 , and 13.75% on June 30, 2024 . The regulatory requirement for this ratio is 9.00%. \"Loans increased $8 million in the second quarter as our pipeline grew to the highest level we've seen since the end of the pandemic. Deposits increased $11 million as we have experienced growth in core deposits. We have been building our infrastructure to drive future growth with the establishment of our loan production office in downtown Salinas , and, later this year, we will be opening a branch office in Santa Cruz ,\" said Anker Fanoe, CEO. \"Changes in our market resulting from the acquisitions of competitor banks present opportunities for growth. We have increased loan and deposit production and support personnel to take advantage of these opportunities, and will also be increasing our spending on marketing. We recently brought on an outstanding commercial lending team with deep experience in our target areas, and they are starting to gain traction. These investments will reduce current net income, but we believe they will lead to greater profitability in the long term. I am excited about the Company's prospects as business conditions change,\" stated CEO Fanoe. \"Our liquidity position remains strong, as our primary liquidity ratio (cash, deposits held in other banks, and securities as a percentage of total assets) was 11.0% on June 30, 2025 , compared to 12.9% for the same month a year ago. As of June 30, 2025 , on-balance sheet liquidity totaled $63 million and contingent liquidity, which includes borrowing capacity with the Federal wire.com/news-releases/pacific-valley-bancorp-announces-its-second-quarter-2025-financial-results-302515386.html SOURCE Pacific Valley Bancorp News Provided by PR Newswire via QuoteMedia STOCK INFORMATION FOR PACIFIC VALLEY BANCORP 1D5D1M3M6M1Y2Y3Y5Y10Y20Y Volume: Price Volume Frequency:DAILY Jun 30 Jul 2 Jul 4 Jul 10 Jul 14 Jul 16 Jul 18 Jul 22 Jul 24 Jul 26 Jul 28 Jul 30 10.2 10.3 10.4 0 12k MORE RECENT NEWS ABOUT PACIFIC VALLEY BANCORP Pacific Valley Bancorp Announces Its First Quarter 2025 Financial Results Pacific Valley Bank Expands Commercial Banking Team with Six Key Appointments Pacific Valley Bank Appoints Banking Veteran David V.

    "content": "and Media Regional Health Properties, Inc. Outlines Reasons for Regional Shareholders to Vote YES for Proposed Merger with SunLink Health Systems, Inc. ATLANTA, GA, July 28, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Regional Health Properties, Inc. (“Regional”) (OTCBQ: RHEP) (OTCQB: RHEPA) (OTCQB: RHEPB), a self-managed healthcare real estate investment company that invests primarily in real estate purposed for senior living and long-term care, today issues the following statement to its common stock shareholders. Shareholders recently may have received or seen communication from two of Regional’s shareholders, Ken Grossman and Charlie Frischer, opposing the pending merger (the “merger”) of Regional and SunLink Health Systems, Inc. (“SunLink”). Please do not be confused by these shareholders. Regional does not believe that Messrs. Grossman and Frischer have the Regional common shareholders’ best interests in mind. Mr. Grossman is the owner of approximately 6% of Regional’s Series B preferred stock, but owns only approximately 1% of Regional’s common stock. Lisewise, Mr. Frischer owns approximately 21% of the Regional’s Series B preferred stock, but owns only approximately 7% of Regional’s common stock. Mr. Morrison’s communications with Messrs. Grossman and Frischer over the years have been primarily related to their Series B preferred stock. Regional’s belief is that their interest is in advancing the interests of the Series B preferred shareholders, not those of the common shareholders. Specifically, please be aware that: 1. The purported “two detailed written offers” are not entirely as described by both gentlemen. There were many conditions and uncertainties to those “offers” with no certainty of satisfaction or accomplishment – one actually has been superseded by an offer for fewer shares – whereas the merger is well documented and agreed. Mr. Morrison’s personal belief is that they may be working in concert to push to liquidate Regional Health, in which event the Series B preferred shareholders would receive much, if not all, of the proceeds . Regional encourages you to read Regional’s Form 8-K filing with the SEC on July 18, 2025, July 24, 2025 and July 28, 2025 for additional disclosures as well as the tender offer that was filed on July 18, 2025. The tender offer is only for a control position – but not all or even a majority of the Regional common shares. 2. It is not at all clear to Regional how Mr. Grossman derives the $4.00 share value as mentioned in his letter. As noted, Mr. Morrison believes his intent is likely to proceed with the liquidation with the proceeds flowing first to the Series B preferred shareholders and then the Series A preferred shareholders, until they are fully redeemed. Mr. Morrison believes there would be little, if any, proceeds left for your common shares. 3. Both Regional’s and SunLink’s common shares have traded higher since the merger announcement on January 6, 2025. Regional is approximately 120% higher, and Sunlink is approximately 30% higher. Regional believes the SunLink merger is positive for ALL shareholders because: 1. The merger brings capital to the combined company (approximately $6,000,000). This will improve Regional’s balance sheet, and, Regional believes, substantially aid operations. This is intended to, among other things, give the combined company greater access to capital for the benefit of all shareholders as well as Regional’s patients, dedicated employees and its portfolio of facilities. 2. The merger brings additional, experienced management to the combined company. 3. The merger brings a solid level of industry and public-company Board expertise to the combined company, expertise which Regional believes is much greater than usual for companies the size of the combined company. 4. The merger has the potential to improve shareholder value for both the common and preferred holders, whereas a liquidation would primarily benefit the preferred holders. 5. The merger provides a path to produce internally generated free cash flow which can be used to redeem the Series B preferred over time. 6. The merger allows for an improved trading market and the potential to re-list your common shares on a national market, which an “orderly liquidation” may not. Time is very critical. Please vote your shares FOR the merger today.

    "content": "and Media Regional Health Properties, Inc. Outlines Reasons for Regional Shareholders to Vote YES for Proposed Merger with SunLink Health Systems, Inc. ATLANTA, GA, July 28, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Regional Health Properties, Inc. (“Regional”) (OTCBQ: RHEP) (OTCQB: RHEPA) (OTCQB: RHEPB), a self-managed healthcare real estate investment company that invests primarily in real estate purposed for senior living and long-term care, today issues the following statement to its common stock shareholders. Shareholders recently may have received or seen communication from two of Regional’s shareholders, Ken Grossman and Charlie Frischer, opposing the pending merger (the “merger”) of Regional and SunLink Health Systems, Inc. (“SunLink”). Please do not be confused by these shareholders. Regional does not believe that Messrs. Grossman and Frischer have the Regional common shareholders’ best interests in mind. Mr. Grossman is the owner of approximately 6% of Regional’s Series B preferred stock, but owns only approximately 1% of Regional’s common stock. Lisewise, Mr. Frischer owns approximately 21% of the Regional’s Series B preferred stock, but owns only approximately 7% of Regional’s common stock. Mr. Morrison’s communications with Messrs. Grossman and Frischer over the years have been primarily related to their Series B preferred stock. Regional’s belief is that their interest is in advancing the interests of the Series B preferred shareholders, not those of the common shareholders. Specifically, please be aware that: 1. The purported “two detailed written offers” are not entirely as described by both gentlemen. There were many conditions and uncertainties to those “offers” with no certainty of satisfaction or accomplishment – one actually has been superseded by an offer for fewer shares – whereas the merger is well documented and agreed. Mr. Morrison’s personal belief is that they may be working in concert to push to liquidate Regional Health, in which event the Series B preferred shareholders would receive much, if not all, of the proceeds . Regional encourages you to read Regional’s Form 8-K filing with the SEC on July 18, 2025, July 24, 2025 and July 28, 2025 for additional disclosures as well as the tender offer that was filed on July 18, 2025. The tender offer is only for a control position – but not all or even a majority of the Regional common shares. 2. It is not at all clear to Regional how Mr. Grossman derives the $4.00 share value as mentioned in his letter. As noted, Mr. Morrison believes his intent is likely to proceed with the liquidation with the proceeds flowing first to the Series B preferred shareholders and then the Series A preferred shareholders, until they are fully redeemed. Mr. Morrison believes there would be little, if any, proceeds left for your common shares. 3. Both Regional’s and SunLink’s common shares have traded higher since the merger announcement on January 6, 2025. Regional is approximately 120% higher, and Sunlink is approximately 30% higher. Regional believes the SunLink merger is positive for ALL shareholders because: 1. The merger brings capital to the combined company (approximately $6,000,000). This will improve Regional’s balance sheet, and, Regional believes, substantially aid operations. This is intended to, among other things, give the combined company greater access to capital for the benefit of all shareholders as well as Regional’s patients, dedicated employees and its portfolio of facilities. 2. The merger brings additional, experienced management to the combined company. 3. The merger brings a solid level of industry and public-company Board expertise to the combined company, expertise which Regional believes is much greater than usual for companies the size of the combined company. 4. The merger has the potential to improve shareholder value for both the common and preferred holders, whereas a liquidation would primarily benefit the preferred holders. 5. The merger provides a path to produce internally generated free cash flow which can be used to redeem the Series B preferred over time. 6. The merger allows for an improved trading market and the potential to re-list your common shares on a national market, which an “orderly liquidation” may not. Time is very critical. Please vote your shares FOR the merger today.

(the \" Company \" or \" Invesque \") (TSX: IVQ) (TSX: IVQ.U) announced today that over the last 40 days it has transitioned the day-to-day management of four assets to new operating partners and closed on the sale of eleven seniors housing communities via two separate transactions. On June 18, 2025 , the Company transitioned management of a community in Zachary, Louisiana from a triple-net lease to a third-party management structure with Viva Senior Living , a regional operator that currently manages more than 20 assets, one other asset which is owned by the Company. On July 1, 2025 , the Company transitioned management of three memory care communities in Texas and Arkansas to Constant Care Management Company (\"CCMC\"), one of the industry's premier memory care providers. CCMC has significant experience operating in both states and the Company anticipates improvements in financial performance because of the transition. On July 14, 2025 , the Company sold a community in Syracuse, New York for US$5.8 million . The community was previously managed by Hearth Management under a triple-net lease. A portion of the proceeds from the sale were used to repay property level debt associated with the asset and pay other transaction-related costs. On July 25, 2025 , the Company sold ten memory care assets in Texas , Indiana , Arkansas and Michigan that were previously managed via a triple-net lease by CCMC for US$83.2 million . A portion of the proceeds from the sale were used to repay property level debt associated with the assets and pay other transaction-related costs. \"Year-to-date, we have executed on the sale of 32 assets for US$423.1 million .,\" commented Adlai Chester , Chief Executive Officer of the Company. \"These transactions allow us to accumulate cash to repay all or some of the outstanding debt and debentures and ultimately return capital to our shareholders. We will continue to analyze the best strategy for each remaining asset in our portfolio to ensure the right operator is managing each property or portfolio to drive shareholder value\". About Invesque Invesque is a North American health care real estate company with an investment thesis focused on the premise that an aging demographic in North America will continue to utilize health care services in growing proportion to the overall economy. The Company currently capitalizes on this opportunity by investing in a portfolio of income-generating, predominantly private pay seniors housing communities. Invesque's portfolio includes investments primarily in independent living, assisted living, and memory care, which are operated under long-term leases and joint venture arrangements with industry-leading operating partners.

(NASDAQ: RXST) between November 7, 2024 and July 8, 2025 , both dates inclusive (the \"Class Period\"). A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than September 22, 2025 . So What: If you purchased RxSight securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement.

A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than September 22, 2025 . A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. Why Rosen Law: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs' Bar. Many of the firm's attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. According to the lawsuit, throughout the Class Period, defendants made false and misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) RxSight was experiencing \"adoption challenges\" and/or structural issues resulting in declines in sales and utilization; (2) defendants had overstated the demand for RxSight's products; (3) as a result, RxSight was unlikely to meet its own previously issued financial guidance for fiscal year 2025; and (4) as a result of the foregoing, defendants' positive statements about RxSight's business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.

No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor's ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

Food & Beverage packaging revenues were challenged in Q2, with Canadian strength offset by US weakness. The launch of our ecommerce channel toward the end of summer and an updated pricing strategy that launched in late June position us well for the second half of 2025. Our Cosmetic business experienced a similar tariff headwind in May but strong April and June results more than offset this impact for a strong positive quarter. The absence of supply disruptions that challenged Q2 2024 also helped drive relative performance. The ecommerce channel for this group launched in late July and we look forward to monitoring its performance closely. Organically, Healthcare saw a decline in consumables, offset by strength medspa capital, particularly lower-price-point items. This was primarily driven by a one-off sale of syringes in 2024 and Parata consumables. The negative comps from the Parata loss will conclude in Q3. Our Healthcare business welcomed DermapenWorld into the family at the beginning of June. This acquisition includes an upfront investment of $55M CAD, with a second payment contingent on performance through 2026, and is the major driver of our change in leverage ratio to 1.1x. This addition represents a strong step forward in our aesthetics OEM strategy and will allow us to more rapidly expand global distribution of the Luvo and WorldPRP brands. The closing of this deal represents the fourth significant M&A transaction in 12 months and presents us with significant integration and organic operating needs. Management is now turning its focus to integration for the remainder of the year. In sum, our business units are performing well despite macroeconomic hiccups and with important channel launches on the horizon and significant recent acquisitions, we are well positioned for a strong second-half of 2025\" commented John Glynn , Director and Trustee.

    "content": "and Media Farmers & Merchants Bancorp, Inc. Reports 2025 Second-Quarter and Year-to-Date Financial Results ARCHBOLD, Ohio, July 28, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Farmers & Merchants Bancorp, Inc. (Nasdaq: FMAO) today reported financial results for the 2025 second quarter and year-to-date ended June 30, 2025. 2025 Second Quarter Financial and Operating Highlights (at June 30, 2025 and on a year-over-year basis unless noted) 89 consecutive quarters of profitability Net income increased 35.7% to $7.7 million, or $0.56 per basic and diluted share Net interest margin expands for fourth consecutive quarter, up 51 basis points year-over-year to 3.22% Total loans increased by $67.2 million, or 2.6% to $2.63 billion Total assets increased by $23.1 million, or 0.7% to $3.35 billion Total deposits increased by $69.2 million, or 2.6% to $2.71 billion Efficiency ratio improved to 64.93%, compared to 69.03% Asset quality remains at historically strong levels with nonperforming loans of only $3.7 million Net charge-offs to average loans of 0.00% Tier 1 leverage ratio was 8.50% Lars B. Eller, President and Chief Executive Officer, stated, “Net income for the 2025 second quarter was one of the most profitable quarters and our second-strongest second quarter in F&M’s 128-year history. This performance was driven by strong levels of core profitability, continued growth in our net interest margin, and the successful execution of our multi-year strategic plan. Over the past 12 months, we have enhanced our product offerings, simplified account openings, and continued our focus on attracting and developing proven talent across our regions. The positive momentum we are experiencing today is a direct result of these efforts, as well as our team’s commitment to helping people in our communities live their best lives.” Mr. Eller continued, “Total revenue growth, which is defined by net interest income plus noninterest income, grew by 18.2% year-over-year in the 2025 second quarter, compared to 16.7% in the 2025 first quarter. This growth continues to significantly outpace the rise in noninterest expenses, contributing to a more favorable efficiency ratio and ongoing improvements in core profitability.” “Supporting this revenue momentum is the ongoing expansion of our net interest margin, which increased 51 basis points year-over-year and 19 basis points from the 2025 first quarter. Net interest margin is benefiting from higher asset yields as existing loans reprice and new originations are booked at more favorable rates. At the same time, our growing customer relationships and a more stable interest rate environment have improved our cost of funds.” Income Statement Net income for the 2025 second quarter ended June 30, 2025, was $7.7 million, compared to $5.7 million for the same period last year. Net income per basic and diluted share for the 2025 second quarter was $0.56, compared to $0.42 for the same period last year. Net income for the 2025 first half ended June 30, 2025, was $14.7 million, compared to $11.0 million for the same period last year. Net income per basic and diluted share for the 2025 first half was $1.07, compared to $0.81 for the same period last year. Deposits At June 30, 2025, total deposits were $2.71 billion, an increase of 2.6% from June 30, 2024. The Company’s cost of interest-bearing liabilities was 2.83% for the quarter ended June 30, 2025, compared to 3.18% for the quarter ended June 30, 2024. Mr. Eller commented, “We ended the second quarter with $2.71 billion in deposits, reflecting the success of our efforts to expand relationship-based banking across the Ohio, Indiana, and Michigan markets. Building on recent product enhancements, we are also investing in new tools and capabilities to expand our marketing efforts and better communicate the value of F&M’s offerings.” Loan Portfolio and Asset Quality “Loan demand remains strong, with total loans, net increasing sequentially by $45.0 million, or at a 7.0% annualized rate. We are managing growth with disciplined pricing and remain focused on maintaining strong asset quality. Net charge offs to average loans have been under 0.03% for 17 consecutive quarters, demonstrating the growing sophistication of our credit cultural and risk management capabilities,” continued Mr. Eller. Total loans, net at June 30, 2025, increased 2.6%, or by $67.2 million to $2.63 billion, compared to $2.56 billion at June 30, 2024. The year-over-year increase was driven primarily by higher commercial real estate, commercial and industrial, and agricultural loans, partially offset primarily by lower agricultural real estate, consumer real estate, and consumer loans. Compared to the quarter ended December 31, 2024, total loans, net at June 30, 2025, increased by 2.5% or $65.0 million. F&M continues to closely monitor its loan portfolio with a particular emphasis on higher risk sectors. Nonperforming loans were $3.7 million, or 0.14% of total loans at June 30, 2025, compared to $2.5 million, or 0.10% of total loans at June 30, 2024, and $3.1 million, or 0.12% at December 31, 2024. F&M maintains a well-balanced, diverse and high performing CRE portfolio. CRE loans represented 51.2% of the Company’s total loan portfolio at June 30, 2025. F&M’s CRE portfolio included the following categories at June 30, 2025: CRE Category Dollar Balance Percent of CRE Portfolio ( *) Percent of Total Loan Portfolio ( *) Industrial $ 281,599 20.9% 10.7% Retail 213,309 15.8% 8.1% Multi-family 213,029 15.8% 8.1% Hotels 172,026 12.8% 6.5% Office 139,844 10.4% 5.3% Gas Stations 77,527 5.8% 3.0% Food Service 52,205 3.9% 2.0% Senior Living 31,088 2.3% 1.2% Development 28,565 2.1% 1.1% Auto Dealers 26,744 2.0% 1.0% Other 110,017 8.2% 4.2% Total CRE $ 1,345,953 100.0% 51.2% * Numbers have been rounded At June 30, 2025, the Company’s allowance for credit losses to nonperforming loans was 720.35%, compared to 1,016% at June 30, 2024, and up from 586.38% at March 31, 2025. The allowance to total loans was 1.08% at June 30, 2025, compared to 1.06% at June 30, 2024. Including accretable yield adjustments, associated with the Company’s prior acquisitions, F&M’s allowance for credit losses to total loans was 1.07% at June 30, 2025, compared to 1.10% at June 30, 2024. Mr. Eller concluded, “We continue to believe F&M is in a strong position because of the platform we have built and the strategies we are pursuing to grow our business profitability. We expect continued loan growth, stable asset quality, and further expansion in our net interest margin to support increasing levels of profitability in the back half of 2025. As a result, we continue to believe 2025 will be another good year for F&M.” Stockholders’ Equity and Dividends Total stockholders’ equity increased 8.7% to $350.8 million, or $25.56 per share at June 30, 2025, from $322.7 million, or $23.59 per share at June 30, 2024.

(TSXV:EPL)(OTCQB:EGPLF) (\"EPL\" or \"Eagle Plains\") has received conditional approval from the TSX Venture Exchange to amend the term of 2,220,750 outstanding common share purchase warrants which were issued in connection with a non-brokered private placement completed in August, 2023, (see EPL news release dated August 3rd, 2023). The warrants have a current expiry date of August 2nd, 2025. The share purchase warrants are subject to an accelerated expiry at the option of the Company if the published closing trade price of the common shares on the TSX Venture Exchange is greater than or equal to $.50 for any 20 consecutive trading days, in which event the holder may be given notice that the warrants will expire 30 days following the date of such notice. The common share purchase warrants may be exercised by the holder during the 30-day period between the notice and the expiration of the common share purchase warrants. Eagle Plains has applied to extend the expiry date for an additional 12 months to a revised date of August 2nd, 2026. The exercise price and acceleration clause of the warrants will remain unchanged, at 30 cents per warrant.

    "content": "and Media BOARDWALKTECH REPORTS FOURTH QUARTER AND ANNUAL FISCAL 2025 FINANCIAL RESULTS Canada NewsWire CUPERTINO, Calif. , July 28, 2025 /CNW/ - (TSXV: BWLK) (OTCQB: BWLKF) - Boardwalktech Software Corp. (\"Boardwalktech\" or the \"Company\"), a leading digital ledger platform and enterprise software solutions company, is pleased to report its financial results for fiscal year 2025 ended March 31, 2025 . All figures are reported in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise indicated. Boardwalktech's financial statements are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (\"IFRS\"). Financial Highlights: Revenue for Fiscal 2025 totaled $4.8 million compared to $6.0 million for Fiscal 2024. The portion of revenue from new and recurring SaaS licenses earned in Fiscal 2025 decreased by 23% year-over-year due to the impact from two previously disclosed customers that did not renew due to internal reorganizations, partially offset by a 9% increase in professional services revenue. Annual recurring revenue (\"ARR\"), a non-IFRS metric, at March 31, 2025 was $4.0 million . The Company defines ARR, a non-IFRS metric, as the annual recurring revenue expected based on trailing quarterly revenue from license subscriptions and certain recurring services. Gross margin for Fiscal 2025 was 87.7%, comparable with 89.6% in Fiscal 2024. Adjusted EBITDA for Fiscal 2025 was $(1.8) million , compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $(1.6) million for Fiscal 2024. Non-IFRS net loss for Fiscal 2025 (as defined in the Adjusted EBITDA and Non-IFRS Financial Measures section) was $(2.2) million , $(0.04) per basic and diluted share, versus the $(1.7) million non-IFRS loss for Fiscal 2024, $(0.03) per basic and diluted share. Reported IFRS loss for Fiscal 2025 was $(3.2) million , $(0.06) per basic and diluted share, versus a net loss of $(3.1) million for Fiscal 2024, $(0.06) per basic and diluted share. Adjusted operating expenses for Fiscal 2025 totaled $6.0 million , a $0.9 million decrease from the $6.9 million of adjusted operating expenses reported for Fiscal 2024 which reflect the impact of the Company's realignment and cost efforts announced during the last fiscal year. The ending cash balance as of March 31, 2025 was $0.4 million , plus $0.6 million of trade receivables, for a total of $1.0 million . Outstanding debt as at March 31, 2025 was $2.6 million which was drawn against the previously announced $4 million line of credit from Celtic Bank. Due to requirements under IFRS, this debt was reclassified under current liabilities even though the final debt maturity remains in March of 2027. Subsequent Events Subsequent to March 31, 2025 , the Company closed two tranches (on June 13, 2025 and July 24, 2025 ) of non-brokered placements under a LIFE Offering, raising a gross total, before expenses and fees of $0.55 million (CAD $0.75 million ). When combined with the original LIFE Offering closed during Q4 of Fiscal 2025, the Company raised a gross amount of $1.3 million (CAD $1.86 million ) to fund working capital, balance sheet, and growth needs. Operations Highlights Exiting Fiscal 2025 On January 16, 2025 , the Company announced that a Fortune 500 food and snack manufacturing client had signed a 5-year extension to license and further deploy Boardwalktech's supply chain solution, with the Company projecting the renewal to generate in excess of US$300,000 of license revenue over the term of this extension, not including potential professional services work or usage-based upside revenue. On January 22, 2025 , the Company and LTIMindtree (NSE: LTIM) (BSE: 540005), a global technology consulting and digital solutions company, announced they had expanded their partnership including current work at a top 5 U.S. joint banking client to remediate the risk of End User Computing applications (EUCs) through licensed use of the Boardwalk Velocity software product. On February 6, 2025 , the Company announced the extension and expansion of its existing engagement with an existing Top 5 US bank customer, achieving a milestone at the end of January 2025 in the delivery of its Velocity product, which increases annual recurring revenue and expands professional services agreements with multiple partners through 2025 that will deliver over $300,000 of incremental revenue to the Company from this engagement, which represents a doubling to comparable levels in the prior year. On March 17, 2025 , the Company announced the closing of an initial tranche of a non-brokered private placement of 8,576,573 units of the Company at the price of C$0.13 per Unit for gross proceeds of C$1,114,954 pursuant to the Listed Issuer Financing Exemption of National Instrument 45-106 - Prospectus Exemptions. Concurrently with the completion of the LIFE Offering, the Company also issued 250,000 Units on a non-brokered basis to United States Investors, at US$0.09 (equivalent of C$0.13 ) with equivalent commercial terms for each warrant per Unit. On May 12, 2025 , the Company announced a new strategic partnership with Zideas Consulting, a respected technology advisory firm focused on digital transformation, as well as the appointment of Jay Chakraborty , Principal of Zideas Consulting, to the Company's Advisory Board. On May 14, 2025 , the Company announced the appointment of Miles Ravitz to its corporate Advisory Board. Mr. Ravitz is an executive with Promontory Financial Group, a business unit of IBM Consulting, and is expected to act as both an advisor and liaison between the Company and its customer prospects. \"Fiscal 2026 is already shaping up to be a pivotal year for Boardwalktech and its investors,\" said Andrew Duncan , CEO of Boardwalktech Software. \"Our recent $1.3 million in financings has strengthened our balance sheet and enabled us to focus more on execution. We've made strong progress with major U.S. banks, deepened relationships with large multinational enterprises, and have positioned the Company for potential geographic expansion overseas. These milestones reflect growing market recognition of the value Boardwalktech delivers, particularly as organizations confront increasingly complex data environments, risk management, and compliance demands ranging from financial markets to supply chain.\" \"Looking ahead, we're preparing to launch a major innovation: the Boardwalktech Grid Security Protocol,\" continued Mr. Duncan. \"Built on our patented Digital Ledger, and a new patent recently issued specifically focused on authentication and security, our Grid security system is focused on Agentic AI and the authentication and secure movement of information between the enterprise and AI Bots and AI to AI communication. It is also designed to secure the way AI agents and enterprise bots authenticate and interact, a foundational piece of the future of AI, B2B automation and digital commerce. It brings the same immutability and auditability that define and differentiate our core platform, and addresses a massive pain point in authentication, password management, session management and token -level security without creating new silos or complexity. Entities such as Citibank or Comcast can experience 38-40% of its customer service calls just on the resetting of passwords (resulting in billions of dollars in support costs). In simplest terms, the Boardwalktech Grid Security Protocol eliminates passwords using our time-stamp cuboid/digital ledger technology within the Grid and can reduce or even eliminate such inefficiencies and massive costs by removing the hassle and problems of managing and maintaining passwords while actually improving overall security. We look forward to sharing more details and commercial developments in the coming months.\" About Boardwalktech Software Corp.

Announces its Fourth-Quarter and Year-End Results OWINGS MILLS, Md., July 28, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Universal Safety Products, Inc. (formerly Universal Security Instruments, Inc.) (NYSE American LLC: UUU) today announced its financial results for the fourth quarter and its fiscal year ended March 31, 2025. The Company reported: For the fourth quarter ended March 31, 2025, sales increased $1,780,152 (40.0%) to $6,226,621 from $4,446,469 from the comparable period last year. The Company reported net income of $1,302,551, or $0.56 per basic and diluted share compared to a net loss of $776,671, or $0.34 per basic and diluted share for the comparable period of the previous year. For the twelve months ended March 31, 2025, sales increased $4,045,881 (20.7%) to $23,563,554 versus $19,517,673 for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024. The Company reported net income of $500,684, or $0.22 per basic and diluted share, versus a net loss of $695,790 or $0.30 per basic and diluted share, for the same period last year. As previously reported, on May 22, 2025, the Company closed on the sale of its smoke alarm and carbon monoxide alarm business and certain other assets to Feit Electric Company. The Company intends to continue marketing its product lines other than smoke alarms and carbon monoxide alarms. However, all of the Company’s products are imported from the People’s Republic of China. The Company’s ability to sell those products at competitive prices depends, among other things, on the tariffs to which imports of those products will be subject. The Company is also exploring other business opportunities to drive long-term value for shareholders. The increase in net income for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2025, is attributed primarily to an increase in sales to retail customers, and to recording an income tax benefit associated with the reversal of a portion of the reserve for deferred tax assets arising from the gain on the sale of assets. In addition, certain revisions increasing the net loss in the prior year have been recorded. The Company also announced that today it has filed its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2025, with the Securities and Exchange Commission, thereby curing the Company’s previously announced non-compliance with the continued listing standards of NYSE American LLC.

About DBV Technologies DBV Technologies is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing treatment options for food allergies and other immunologic conditions with significant unmet medical need. DBV is currently focused on investigating the use of its proprietary VIASKIN® patch technology to address food allergies, which are caused by a hypersensitive immune reaction and characterized by a range of symptoms varying in severity from mild to life-threatening anaphylaxis. Millions of people live with food allergies, including young children. Through epicutaneous immunotherapy (EPIT), the VIASKIN® patch is designed to introduce microgram amounts of a biologically active compound to the immune system through intact skin. EPIT is a new class of non-invasive treatment that seeks to modify an individual’s underlying allergy by re-educating the immune system to become desensitized to allergen by leveraging the skin’s immune tolerizing properties. DBV is committed to transforming the care of food allergic people. The Company’s food allergy programs include ongoing clinical trials of VIASKIN Peanut in peanut allergic toddlers (1 through 3 years of age) and children (4 through 7 years of age). DBV Technologies is headquartered in Châtillon, France, with North American operations in Warren, NJ.
